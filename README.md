## üíª System Requirements

To get started, make sure you have the following installed:

  * **OpenGL 4.3** (Shading language 430)
  * `numpy`
  * `pillow`
  * `pyglet` or `pygame`
  * `PyOpenGL`
  * `PyOpenGL-accelerate` (optional)

It currently supports **Windows** and **Linux**, with Mac support not yet tested.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Anaconda Crash

If you're experiencing an `ImportError: DLL load failed` when using Anaconda, it's often due to a conflict with the `Pillow` library. Here are three solutions you can try, starting with the most straightforward.

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 44, in <module>
    from SupremacyEngine.Common import CustomQueue, CustomPipe
...
  File "...\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\PIL\Image.py", line 90, in <module>
    from . import _imaging as core
ImportError: DLL load failed
```

  * **Solution 1: Install from the Anaconda channel**
    ```bash
    conda install -c anaconda pillow
    ```
  * **Solution 2: Install a specific version from conda-forge**
    ```bash
    conda install --channel conda-forge pillow=5
    ```
  * **Solution 3: Reinstall using pip**
    ```bash
    conda remove pillow
    pip install pillow
    ```
